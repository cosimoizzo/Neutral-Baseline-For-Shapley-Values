Title: 'A Baseline for Shapley Values in MLPs: from Missingness to Neutrality'

Abstract: 'Deep neural networks have gained momentum on the basis of their accuracy, however these are often criticised to be black-boxes. Thus, researchers have proposed methods to explain their predictions. Among explainability methods, feature attribution methods have been favoured for their strong theoretical foundation: the Shapley values. Their limitation is the need to define a baseline representing the missingness of a feature. We present a method to choose a baseline based on a neutrality value: a parameter defined by decision makers at which their choices are determined by the returned value of the model being either below or above it.'
